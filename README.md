# Blitz :runner:
Blitzcan automatically accept and deliver quests for you. It is a no-nonsense and simple to configure solution to avoid going over quest intefaces over and over again. You can skip quests by holding a keybind or by selecting specific daily/repeatable quests to always automate. It can even show a progress bar when delivering the same quest multiple times in a row, which is particularly useful in Classic servers.

Complete quests faster and stop wasting time.
