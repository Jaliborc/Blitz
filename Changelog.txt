Remade Blitz completely. Large list of changes below.
* Rewritten all the code for more stability and efficiency

** As such, the "enabled quests" list had to be reset
** Uses much less memory
* Now is able to select the "best" repeatable quest (if there is a quest to deliver a stack of items, and another to deliver a single one, it chooses the stack first)
* Added several new options
** //Accept Quests// (accepts **any** quest)
** //Deliver Quest// (delivers **any** completed quest)
** //Select Rewards// (automatically chooses the most valuable reward)
* Blitz Display
** Fixed all the bugs
** Renamed to //Blitz Progress//
** Is now //Load on Demand//
** Now only shows if you can deliver the repeatable quest more than once
** Other minor tweaks
